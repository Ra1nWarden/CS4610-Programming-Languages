\section{Consider the rules for the constant propagation algorithm discussed in class}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $C_{in}(x,s) = \# \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad C_{out}(x, s) = \#$
\item $C_{in}(x, x \leftarrow c) \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad C_{out}(x, x \leftarrow c) = c \qquad \text{(c is a constant)}$
\item $C_{out}(x, x \leftarrow f(...)) = *$
\item $E(x) \neq E(y) \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad C_{out}(x, y \leftarrow ...) = C_{in}(x, y \leftarrow ...)$
\item $C_{in}(x,s) = lub\{ C_{out}(x, p ) \mid p \text{ is a predecessor of s} \}$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Give a concise English description for each of rules 1-4.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the value of $x$ is not reachable before an expression that does not involve $x$, that value is still not reachable after the expression
\item Regardless of the status of the variable $x$, after an expression that assigns constants to a variable, the value of $x$ becomes a constant.
\item Regardless of the status of the variable $x$, after an expression that assigns the value of a function call to $x$, the value of $x$ is unknown. 
\item If the value of $x$ is a constant before an expression that assigns value to $y$, the value of $x$ remains at the same constant after it.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Give two distinct examples that show some set of predecessor $C_{out}$'s and the resulting $C_{in}$ computation.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose $C_{out}(x, p_{1}) = \# \quad C_{out}(x,p_{2}) = \# \quad C_{out}(x, p_{3}) = c$, we have $C_{in}(x, s) = c$
\item Suppose $C_{out}(x, p_{i}) = c \quad C_{out}(x, p_{j}) = d \text{ and } c \neq d$, we have $C_{in}(x, s) = *$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Briefly explain why the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate.}
At the beginning of the algorithm, every value of a variable $x$ is assigned to $\#$. In this algorithm, each variable changes at most twice ($\# \rightarrow c \text{ and } c \rightarrow *$). Since there are finite number of changes, the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate.  

\subsection{Why is it safe to assume that the evaluation of e does not change the value of $x$}
For an assignment to $y$, the only change made is the value of $y$. As for the expression $e$ on the right hand size, single assignment ensures that the value of $x$ does not change.

\section{Consider the fragment of intermediate code}

\subsection{Divide this code into basic blocks.}
\begin{lstlisting}
M0: START 
    if a = 2 goto L3
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
L0: b := 2
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
L1: d := a/ 2
    c := a % b
    if c = 0 goto L2
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
M1: if b >= d goto L3
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
M2: b := b + 1
    goto L1
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
L2: a := a + 1
    goto L0
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
L3: END
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Draw a control-flow graph for this program}
\subsection{Annotate your control-flow graph with the set of variables that are live before and after each statement. Assume that only $a$ is live at the entry to $L3$.}
